# Documentation categories (single-category per file)

Each `docs/*.md` file in this repository has been assigned to the single most relevant category (no overlaps). The selection was made by reading the files and choosing the single category that best matches each file's primary purpose.

## Categories

1) Pairs & Mean-Reversion
   - `pair_trading_analysis.md` — Pair discovery, cointegration, hedge ratio and spread/backtest analysis.
   - `pairs_trading.md` — End-to-end pair trading workflow (discovery → analysis → backtest).
   - `PMR.md` — Streamlit wrapper for pairs mean-reversion strategy and backtesting.
   - `spread_analyzer.md` — Spread analysis and interactive spread/trading signal tool.

2) BBRSI & Bollinger+RSI
   - `bbrsi.md` — BB + RSI strategy description and usage.
   - `bbrsi_backtest.md` — BBRSI backtester with smart debug and run instructions.
   - `bbrsit.md` — BBRSI utilities and programmatic components (trading utilities / module doc).

3) Optimization & Portfolio Simulation
   - `multiStockBBRSI.md` — Multi-stock Bollinger+RSI optimizer using Genetic Algorithms.
   - `MonteCarloSimulation.md` — Monte Carlo portfolio simulations and efficient frontier analysis.

4) Momentum & Multi-Factor
   - `momentumTrading.md` — Momentum indicator dashboard, signals and small backtests.
   - `mims.md` — Multi-factor Intrinsic Momentum Strategy (screening → fundamentals → technicals → allocation).

5) Market Making & Execution
   - `marketMaking.md` — Market-making strategy (volatility-scaled spreads, quoting/backtest logic).
   - `bratr.md` — ATR/volatility-based trading/execution reference (fits execution/market-making context).

6) Correlation & Indicator Utilities
   - `correlation.md` — Correlation matrix, indicator calculators (BB, RSI, ATR, MACD), and heatmap utilities.

## Notes
- Each file is assigned a single category by primary intent; some files contain material that could fit other categories (utilities, optimization sections, or Streamlit UI notes), but the mapping above chooses the dominant intent only.
- If you prefer a tag-based mapping (file → multiple categories) I can create that instead.

## Next steps
- I can (choose one):
  - commit this file into the repo (already added as `docs/categories_summary.md`),
  - or export the mapping as JSON/CSV if you want to consume it programmatically.
